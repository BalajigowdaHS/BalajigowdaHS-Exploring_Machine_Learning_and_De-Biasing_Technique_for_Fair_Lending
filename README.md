### Machine Learning and Fair Lending Project Content

HMDA_22_Sample.csv: A 10% randomized dataset consisting of approximately $1.6 million
observations. This data is used to create the various dashboards and the machine preliminary
machine learning models.

HMDA 2022 Schema: This document contains various sheets explaining the content of
variables and observations in the HMDA 2022 dataset.

Approved & Denied Model (Data Cleaning and Model Selection): Python code for data
cleaning, various model training, and model selection based on multiple performance metrics.

Approved & Denied Model (Bias Removal on XGB Model): The Python code for bias
removal on the best-performing model.

High-Priced Model (Data Cleaning and Model Selection): The Python code for data cleaning,
various model training, and model selection based on multiple performance metrics.

High-Priced Model (Bias Removal on XGB Model): The Python code for bias removal on the
best-performing model.

Pre_Approval_Denial_Debias: The clean dataset used to perform all the de-biasing techniques
in the Approval and Denial model.

Pre_High_Priced_Debias: The clean dataset used to perform all the de-biasing techniques in the
High-Priced model.

Approved & Denied De-Biasing Techniques: The Python code for running all the de-biasing
techniques on the Approved & Denied Model.

High-Priced De-Biasing Techniques: The Python code for running all the de-biasing techniques
on the High Priced Model.

Machine Learning Explainability and Fair Lending - Dynamic Model: The PowerPoint
presentation incorporated live dashboard graphs into the presentations.

Machine Learning Explainability and fair lending - Static Model: The PowerPoint
Presentation with the static versions of the dashboard if the dashboard is unable to load on the
dynamic model.

HMDA Dashboard: PowerBI dashboard for the 2022 HMDA dataset. Requires PowerBI to
open.
